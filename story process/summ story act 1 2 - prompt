Eternium (Live) Story Text
Story
*** ACT 1 ***
The Shores of Hope
They burned our books and they enslaved us in the name of Ragadam, their twisted lord. On these shores begins my vengeance: I will hunt you, Ragadam, across the worlds!
Ruins of the Dead
I need the strong arm and sharp axe of my old friend, Marcus. I must cross these ruins to reach his village. The dead stand in the way, mumbling Ragadam's name.
Marcus' Village
Marcus must be here. With him by my side, my hunt for Ragadam may stand a chance.
Road to Anderra
We're heading to Anderra to find Eileen the Healer. But the road ahead is crawling with the minions of Magroth, the Demon of the Severed Mountain.
Out of Nowhere
We spent the night in peace and quiet, in an abandoned farm. But then, at dawn, the dead surround us, and so we mean them harm.
Misty Island
The peaceful sorceress Gorgona has been tortured to madness by Ragadam's disciple, Elban, until she gave up the secrets of invoking life from bare stone. Elban left for Levania, but Gorgona still haunts this island, mad and lost, poisoning the waters she once loved.
The Defiler
Only a graveyard lays between us and Anderra. The Demon Magroth has dispatched a Grave Defiler here to unearth more minions for him.
Training Grounds
Your personal training grounds. Hone your skills and gear against target dummies.
Anderra
Eileen the Healer is held captive here, in Anderra. Let's hope we find her before we encounter the Demon Magroth.
The Severed Mountain
Magroth has dwelt for centuries in his mountain, as demons do, their love of caves and fire keeping them contained and content. But then a sinister call silently echoed across the worlds. Magroth heard himself whisper: "Ragadam...", and saw himself rise. Elderath hasn't known peace since.
The Siege of Anderhelm
The Demon Magroth escaped to Anderhelm. We must assault the fortress and end his dominion over these lands.
The Gauntlet
"So, you enjoy slaying my minions?", Ragadam laughs from across the ether. "What if they never stopped coming?"
The Wailing Peaks
Ragadam's Broken Dragon holds Robin the Archer. We must make our way through these frozen peaks to the dragon's den.
The Descent
The grimlins have dug their mines deep inside the mountain. They're not too welcoming of visitors, but we have no choice. We must pass through them if we are to reach the Broken Dragon's den and free Robin.
The Fiery Pits
This cave must be one of the Broken Dragon's lairs. She is not here, and the place swarms with restless minions. We hoped slaying Magroth would stop them, but Ragada still grasps their feeble minds through the Broken Dragon's presence.
The Broken Dragon
A century ago, Ragadam found a dragon egg on the barren moon Levania. Hungry for anguish, he raised the hatchling in chains, clawing at her mind and breaking her spirit. Feeding on her terror, he was invigorated, and sent her then to Elderath, to channel his power into this world.
*** ACT 2 ***
Currents of the Ether
We have defeated the Dragon, and removed Ragadam's Claw from her head, unbreaking her spirit. She now relishes flying between the worlds on the currents of the ether. She has taken us to Levania to hunt for Ragadam, and left on a journey among the stars to cleanse her mind of his terror.
Rain of Fire
We were awed to find our moon is inhabited by strange creatures that seem sentient. Too bad they are aggressive. As we ponder this, several meteors blast huge craters in the plateau ahead. A minute passes, then several more. It almost looks like someone is doing this with a purpose.
Stones and Bones
A crater is a perfect place for an ambush. Let's hope instead of a fight we can have a talk. We just want to find Ragadam.
Canyon of Whispers
The alien creatures we've come to call Levans are not willing to talk to us, and seem to get along well with the walking dead. They look sentient, but not sane. Alien whispers fill this valley, like shreds of the Levans' ragged minds.
Stairway to Levania
The air is fresher, the sand is moist, and lichens grow on some stones. Could the myth of the Levanian Gardens be true?
The Levanian Gardens
The Levanian Gardens are real, but most things growing in them are twisted and tortured, like the spirits of their wretched Levan gardeners.
The Levanian Jungle
The thick forest on the bottom of these once barren canyons weeps quietly in the wind. It could be beautiful, in an alien way, but in the weeping wind we hear a whisper... "Ragadam..." and beauty is drowned by anxiety.
The Scent of Home
We found a huge stone structure, filled with the sound of flowing water and with familiar smells. There are plants from Elderath here, but they're confined and ordered like the vials in alchemist's lab.
River of Blood
In the stone laboratory, we found a log written in archaic Elderan by an Elban the Demiurge. It speaks of Levans as "drones", mentions "Master Ragadam", "Project Desparia" and a "lying snakewitch". We reach a canal where rivulets of thick red ooze are gathering into a sickly parody of a river.
River of Dreams
Flowing out of the colossal system of dams and reservoirs, the ooze changes into clear water, and green plants grow on the shores. We rush to get a drink of water...
Going with the Flow
After drinking the river's water we had hours of horrifying hallucinations. We waited them out in agony until evening, and then continued downstream, keeping our distance from the bank. The river leads us underground, to what looks like another of the Demiurge's water "enrichment" mills.
The Seeds of Life
The Demiurge's log, the whispers in the air, the nightmares in the water, the tortured denizens and plants leave little doubt: Ragadam wants to grow a whole world for himself here, Desparia, a world of beings knowing only anguish, and speaking only his name, for his eternal sustenance.
The Temple
We reach a vast temple, bearing Elban's seal and the words "Elban's Holy Halls" in archaic Elderan above the entrance. As we step in, the gate closes behind us, and a humming starts filling the air, followed by a deep rumble.
