*** ACT 3 ***
The Rusty Planet
Elban's temple turned out to be a space faring vessel, and has transported us to Nirgal, the rusty planet in Elderath's sky. Maybe he and his master Ragadam hide here, among palm trees and pyramids...
Twilight Garden
The beautiful stone cities of Nirgal are inhabited by a reptilian species, who coexist with Ragadam's undead minions. They look like brutal warriors, but architecture (or clothes) seem to elude them.
Beneath the Pyramids
The lush garden's alleys lead us to the entrance to one of these magnificent pyramids. The corridors inside are lit by glass tubes, cold to the touch, and lined by iron conduits that carry fire. 
Path of Sand
We exit the catacombs into a sandy canyon, walled by red, Nirgalian cliffs. The manuscripts we found inside the pyramid indicate this is the way to The Wall, and to Elban's city of Malador.
Oasis
We have been wandering the desert canyons for days. From the top of a high dune, we see in the distance a lake, palm trees and ruins.
Ruins of Minaris
Beautiful arched gates and decorated walls slowly crumble into the red sands. This must have been Minaris, the City of Three Canyons, the old capital of the Southern Nirgal lands, from before the Coming of the Demiurge.
The Wall
Built between two mountain ranges, the titanic Wall once protected the realms of Minaris from the more aggressive peoples of the Mire and Malador in times of war, while the narrow path on its top was used by traders in times of peace.
Trial of the Mire
As we descend off the Wall into the Mire, we find ourselves in a sturdy wooden enclosure. Whatever its purpose might once have been, now it's a place for us to be ambushed by Elban's reptilians and Ragadam's dead.
Murkvale
Murkvale was a village of the Mirefolk, or, as we knew them on Elderath, the Merloks. Now it has been taken over by the Demiurge's creations, the vile reptilians. Beyond it, we can see the walls of Malador.
The City of Malador
Malador, the Crown of the Mire, is being slowly consumed by the jungle's neverending twilight. The screeches of Elban's abominations echo among the stone walls. This is their city now, and the seat of their warlord, Gorlak.
The Crucible of Mawrth
Deep beneath Malador lies the Crucible of Mawrth, a vast dungeon built among flowing fires to contain Mawrth, Nirgal's ancient demon. The demon was long since slain by Elban, and the crucible is his lair now.
*** ACT 4 ***
Demeter, the Shattered World
We travelled to the place that could not be seen from afar and have discovered the fragments of a world floating in space, teeming with life. Whether these people will receive us as allies or conquerors remains to be seen. The temple ship dropped us in a forest.
On Wings of Aether
The Aether is the mysterious energy source that still holds these shattered remains together. There should be 5 kinds of crystals: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue and White.We must collect them all to be able to travel freely across the Aether.
Darkhold Citadel
The once great Keep of Whitemoon, the Ursoc bulwark against the Minotaurs savage attacks, is now a dark shadow upon the bleak land of the Isle of the Ursoc kingdom. The blood crazed servants of Rak’shul now call it Darkhold Citadel. One thing hasn’t changed: it is still considered impregnable, so forbidden knowledge is brought here to be stored. Perhaps this knowledge can be used to reactivate the gateway that would take us to Ragadam.
Blenheim
We learned that Rak’shul is an agent of Ragadam that holds one of the keystone fragments used to power the gateway, and someone named Sivari holds the other. The town of Blenheim seems to be at the center of the spreading corruption. The town is guarded by a fallen champion of the Ursol that has eventually succumbed to the same mysterious “blood craze” as most of their warriors.
The Highroad
We discovered that the blood craze is fabricated by corrupting dragon blood. We must cross the Highroad, the path through the mountains and through ursoc territory, to get to Dragon’s Crag - the only likely source of dragon blood on Demeter. Curing the blood craze will surely disrupt whatever plan Rak’shul has.
Dragon's Crag
Garm, the Keeper guards the Dragonspawn at the center of Dragon’s Crag. He could be under Ragadam’s control, or he could be his captive. Either way, this is where the alchemist corruptor got the dragon blood from.
Morgenheim
Once we stopped the corruption rituals, most of the ursoc begun reverting to their regular selves. Rak’shul the Usurper, Ragadam’s minion who caused the Ursoc blood craze, retreated inside Morgenheim Castle together with his loyalists. He must be dealt with, and we must recover the keystone fragment from him.
Desolation Desert
With the Ursoc usurper dealt with, the blood craze cured and the rightful king back on the throne, we focus on the Minotaur tribes. The Minotaurs are savage warriors who respect strength above all else. We travel to the Desolation Desert in search of the second keystone fragment.
Scartree Forest
We learned that Sivari is the former Warchief of the Scartree tribe, that proclaimed herself Overlord of the Minotaurs. Although not all follow her rule, she and her followers display unnatural strength. We travel through Scartree Forest to reach the Scartree tribe’s home grounds and find the source of her strange and newly gained power. 
Scartree Hold
Before their newfound mysterious strength, the Scartree were the weakest of the Minotaurs. These outcasts learned to construct their settlements undergrounds, unlike the rest of their kind. Scartree Hold is their underground capital. We could find the answers we are looking for here.
Crystal Mountain
The Void Infusers at Scartree Hold were corrupting Aether crystals from Crystal Mountain. If we cut their supply, the source of the Scartree power will be shattered, and the way to Sivari will be open.
Drakenmoor Forest
The watchtower in Drakenmoor Forest could warn Sivari of our impending assault. We must capture the watchtower before we proceed any further.
Drakenmoor Citadel
Drakenmoor Citadel is the seat of power of the Minotaur Overlord. Sivari, the agent of Ragadam that holds the second keystone shard, must be here with her elite forces.
Drakenmoor Catacombs
Sivari fled in the underground catacombs below Drakenmoor Citadel. We must pursue her and obtain the keystone shard.
The Underworld
Kara, the Tempest Queen, leads what’s left of Ragadam’s forces on Demeter from the center of the Underworld Necropolis. Ending her means undoing the threat that Ragadam poses to this collection of worlds.

Xagan’s Letter
To
Professor Alistair Thadden
Anderra Academy of Natural Philosophy

From
Professor Alexander Xagan
Lighthouse Laboratory


Dear Alistair,

I hope my letter finds you as tireless and witty as ever.

Alistair, you know I was never one to fall to superstition or to discourage research, but I am very troubled about this Lifecrafter order at the Academy. Studying Lifecrafting is a noble pursuit, but I fear they're not doing that, my friend.

I have been visited by a triad of Lifecrafters here at the Lighthouse. They have taken to wearing uniforms and bleaching their beards. They requisitioned all the books from the Lighthouse Library against my protests. They were followed by walking skeletons, Alistair.

I fear they are dabbling in necromancy, and I think you suspect that too. 

The Elderan's nights have been tormented enough by these restless dead. You know the will that moves them is not of this world, and cannot be bent by us. Raising them only gives more power to their puppeteer, whose name I will not write or utter.

I urge you, Alistair, try to contain this Lifecrafter order for as long as you can.

I will arrange for [HERONAME] to leave for Anderra.

It is time.

Hoping to hear from you soon, old friend.

Yours truly,
Alexander

Project Desparia Log
Project Desparia, First Sun

I, Elban, High Disciple of Lord and Master Ragadam, have descended upon my Master's former prison world, the barren moon Levania, and for His Eternal Glory I am tasked with Lifecrafting it into a new world, Desparia, where all creatures will live in terror of His Name.
Project Desparia, Sun 72

Before losing her mind, back on that island on Elderath, the lying snakewitch has yielded the secrets of Lifecrafting to me. Or so I thought... for most of the things she said were deceits, aimed at ruining my work, curse her name. I will need slaves to do the work that her magic does not.
Project Desparia, Sun 130
The wretched Mirefolk that Gorlak is sending me from Nirgal are too feeble to work on these arid lands or breathe this thin air. I will have him invade Minaris, and enslave those desert dwelling, trident wielding drones. They might do.
Project Desparia, Sun 276
For his deeds in the siege of the Wall and the fall of Minaris, I honor Gorlak with the title Wallshatter.
Project Desparia, Sun 391
The drones do good work before they die, and Gorlak Wallshatter is sending a templeful more every Sun. The canals are well under way, as are the forest halls and sun mills.
Project Desparia, Sun 447
Lord and Master Ragadam, Glory to His Name, has walked the land of Desparia this Sun. Desparia's forests and critters trembled, Desparia's dead rose, mumbling His Name in terror, and He was pleased.

Having crafted for Him the race of Aztrak warriors, and having started to craft Him a World, He has honored me with my new title, Elban the Demiurge.
Project Desparia, Sun 529
That fool [HERONAME] has somehow managed to slay Magroth, ride the Broken Dragon here, and is now wasting my drones. I'll go have a word with Wallshatter, and see how [HERONAME] likes Desparia until we return.
Gorlak’s Boast
GORLAK WINS!

GORLAK BREAKS WALL AND KILLS MANY HUNDRED. AZTRAK KILL SOME HUNDRED TOO.

MINARIS FALLS!

MINARII NOW GO WORK ON DESPARIA.

MASTER ELBANS WILL IS DONE.

GORLAK DONE IT!

So wrote Gorlak, the First Aztrak, at the fall of Minaris, for the Glory of Ragadam, may forever in terror His name be spoken.
Log Beneath The Pyramid
Lord and Master Ragadam, may forever in terror His Name be spoken, has commanded me to restore the fire engines of Nirgal, so they may power the Crucible beneath Malador and I may complete my work of Firecrafting his Aztrak warriors.

For all the pride I take in my skills, I am humbled by the Master's knowledge of the inner workings of the worlds, Glory be to His Name. For before receiving His instructions, the Mirefolk, Dragonbone and Demonfang essences would not fuse in the Crucible, and I had not the wisdom to know that the Crucible's fires were burning low.

When the engines beneath the Pyramids are pumping fire again, I shall return to Malador and Firecraft the mightiest of the Aztrak, to be their warlord. In praise of the Master's boundless knowledge, I will name him Gorlak, for the Awe that mortals owe to gods.
Gorgonas Origin
From the sea comes the deadliest, most resilient of all life, which is why Ragadam commanded his followers to learn from it in their experiments to create life on the inhospitable surface of Levania. Elban the Demiurge, a clever disciple whose wretched nature was made evident by his fulsome reptilian appearance and hazy breath, followed his esteemed master's example and found someone else to carry out these experiments for him.

Tending to the secluded grove she called home gave Gorgona both purpose and safety in a time when it felt like either could be snatched from you by Ragadam's legions. She was so skilled that she didn't even need her magic to grow fruits, vegetables, and nuts more delicious than could be found anywhere else. No, that magic was reserved for intruders. On those occasions the leaves of the grove would rustle with news of the unwelcomed. Most of the time simply having one of the larger, more gnarled trees uproot itself and come marching toward the stray wanderer would convince them to find a different forest to explore. Gorgona sometimes couldn't help but laugh at the way they flailed as they desperately ran away. She wouldn't have actually hurt anyone who didn't deserve it, but they needn't know that. They just needed to believe the idea of the scary witch whose laughter echoes after fleeing trespassers. On this occasion, before she could even return home from scaring off the last wanderer, the grove notified her of a new presence. Not alive...metallic...lots of them trampling savagely. It had to be Ragadam's automatons! Gorgona hurried to the northern edge of the thick forest expecting the worst. Automatons were generally used as a garrison which meant someone wanted this grove. Arriving quickly she saw there were several dozen of the small rolling automatons accompanied by about twenty of the larger two legged models. They were already starting to divide into smaller groups and fan out. Crouched amongst the tree limbs, Gorgona watched through the shade of the boughs and waited until they were sufficiently far apart, then gave life to the stout trees she spent so much time tending. Their thick limbs tore the larger automatons apart while their roots and trunks smashed the small ones into the earth and ground them into parts. She swiftly moved to the next group of automatons, and then the next, overseeing similar destruction each time. While dispatching the fourth bunch she heard a single automaton that had made its way behind her. As she turned to look at it Gorgona sent a tree limb to smash into the construct. She saw it had a deadly multi-arrow arm that could fire a volley and riddle her body. Instead the machine pointed its arm directly up and fired just one shot before being mangled by the grove. Following the shot with her eyes she saw it become a puff of hazy fumes that quickly descended and clung to her.

Elban had his signal. Vanishing skybreakers who had lain invisible in anticipation of this moment started a hail of meteors. The large, flaming meteors snapped trees in half while the smaller shards were hurled with such force that they bore holes in anything they impacted on. The fires spread quickly, setting Gorgona's army and home ablaze until a sudden storm began driving sheets of rain to combat them. Elban grinned. The witch was definitely the one to lead the experiments. Then he saw her. She'd smashed all of his toys and clearly wanted to do the same to him. Thunder boomed overhead as lightning arced between the clouds. "Show me the power of your world!" he yelled to her over the winds with a challenging, smug look on his face. Obligingly she dropped bolts of lightning from above. Elban held out his hand and immediately her arsenal was turned against her with the electricity being deflected at her. Gorgona was behind a tree in a flash, and then let out a gasp as she felt a small sting in her back and a hand on her shoulder. She barely had time to question how he'd covered that distance before she looked up and saw the smiling madman. "And I'll show you the power of Ragadam's new world."

There wasn't much to greet Gorgona's senses as she began to awaken. Her face was covered so she could only see the tiniest pinpoints of light. Her mouth was gagged, her arms and legs were bound, she was suspended, and there was very little sound except a scraping noise. A hand on her head and a whisper in her ear indicated that her awakening hadn't gone unnoticed. "The work you'll be doing on your island is going to teach us so much." Gorgona smelled something akin to smelted metal on Elban's breath. His lingering touch made her struggle in vain against her bonds. She couldn't feel the magic of the earth around her. No way to free herself or fight back. Elban withdrew his hand and stepped away. "But first Ragadam has to teach you about obedience. It's going to take some time to change you for our needs." The scraping noise she'd heard ended in a loud thump above her. "I'll leave you to your lessons in compliance. Don't worry, we've protected your face with that mask. They'll only be changing the rest of you. It'll take a year or so before they're through so I hope you're patient." Gorgona heard a crank turning and felt her body being lowered into water. Her leg jerked reflexively when something brushed against it. When it then wrapped itself around her leg it felt like a snake. Immediately there were more of them in the water wrapping themselves around every part of her. The small bit of light she could see through the mask was growing narrower and finally disappeared as the crank stopped turning and ended with a clang that told her she was now entombed. Elban left with his usual satisfied grin on his face. There was nothing left to stick around for, he thought. The warped sea snakes would pump her full of their venom again and again slowly transforming her body and her mind. "Maybe I should've taken the gag off her mouth so we could hear her scream."
