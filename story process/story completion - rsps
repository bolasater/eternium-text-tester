Gorgona, realizing the presence of Ragadam's automatons in her grove, joins forces with the protagonist. Together, they devise a plan to defeat Ragadam and put an end to his reign of terror once and for all.

Gorgona reveals that she possesses ancient knowledge of powerful spells and enchantments that can weaken Ragadam's hold on the world. She teaches the protagonist these mystical arts, and they spend days practicing and honing their skills.

As their training progresses, Gorgona confides in the protagonist about her troubled past. She was once a member of the Lifecrafter order, but she grew disillusioned with their use of necromancy and left to protect the natural balance of life. Gorgona's dedication to preserving life and her profound connection to nature make her an invaluable ally in their quest.

Armed with newfound knowledge and skills, the protagonist and Gorgona embark on their final journey to confront Ragadam. They traverse treacherous landscapes, battling through hordes of undead minions and overcoming deadly traps set by Ragadam to protect himself.

Their determination and unwavering resolve drive them forward, and eventually, they reach the heart of Ragadam's fortress. With Gorgona's guidance, the protagonist navigates the labyrinthine corridors, avoiding hidden dangers and neutralizing the fortress's defenses.

At last, they come face to face with Ragadam in his throne room, where he sits upon a dark, twisted throne, surrounded by his most loyal and powerful minions. A fierce battle ensues, with the protagonist and Gorgona fighting side by side, their combined strength and magic proving to be a formidable force.

Gorgona uses her nature-based spells to weaken Ragadam's minions, while the protagonist unleashes a relentless assault on the demon lord himself. With each blow they strike, Ragadam's power wanes, and his minions grow weaker.

As the battle reaches its climax, Gorgona taps into the deep well of her magic and summons the forces of nature to aid them. The ground shakes, and the room fills with a blinding light as vines, roots, and branches burst forth from the earth, entangling Ragadam and his minions, rendering them helpless.

With one final surge of power, the protagonist strikes Ragadam down, severing his connection to the realm and banishing him forever. The fortress begins to crumble, and the protagonist and Gorgona make a hasty escape, narrowly avoiding its collapse.

Outside, the world is bathed in a newfound light. The undead minions disintegrate, their twisted existence undone by Ragadam's defeat. The people rejoice as they witness the dawn of a new era, free from the clutches of darkness.

The protagonist and Gorgona are hailed as heroes, their names etched in the annals of history. They are celebrated for their bravery, resilience, and unwavering determination. Together, they have saved the realm from Ragadam's tyranny and restored hope to its people.

With their mission accomplished, the protagonist bids farewell to Gorgona, grateful for her invaluable assistance and the bond they forged through their shared struggle. Gorgona, content with her role in preserving the balance of nature, returns to her grove, where she continues to watch over and protect the land.

As for the protagonist, their journey is far from over. Having proven themselves as a true champion, they set their sights on new adventures, ready to face any challenge that may come their way. The tale of their triumph over Ragadam and their alliance with Gorgona will be told for generations to come, inspiring future heroes to rise up and defend the realm from evil.
