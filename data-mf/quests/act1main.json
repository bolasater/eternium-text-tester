He allowed the dragon to be born, but then enslaved her. He set his claw in the dragon's mind, filling her with terror and breaking her spirit. The dragon is the conduit through which Ragadam channels his power on our world.||||You must slay the undead minions defending the lair and defeat the dragon, {HERO}. If at all possible, try to free her mind of Ragadam's corruption. No being deserves the fate he gave her.",
