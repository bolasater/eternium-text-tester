Write a comma delimited list of 40 typical fantasy monsters from weakest to strongest in a JSON format. For each monster, write name, description, level, health, attack, and any resistance or weakness they might have.  

Resistances and weaknesses should be from this list: {"none","fire","ice","electricity"}. 
If a monster is known to be resistant to a particular type of damage, they should have that resistance.

If a monster is known to be vulnerable to a particular type of damage, they should have that weakness.

Level = round(sqrt(health*attack)/2)

A red dragon should be the strongest monster. It has health = 100 and attack = 50 and level = 35
